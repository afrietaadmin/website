                          shows on YouTube while she takes a few minutes to
                          herself, maybe with a coffee or a quiet episode of her
                          favorite show. But her current internet keeps
                          stalling, and buffering is all too common. Instead of
                          peace, she’s left mediating her kids’ frustration.

                          Thabo’s work requires a dependable internet connection
                          to stream video calls and transfer large files without
                          interruption. Yet, he’s frustrated by unexpected drops
                          in connectivity or lag that make him appear
                          unprofessional in front of clients. Every time his
                          connection fails, it impacts his productivity and
                          reputation.

                          The difference between winning and losing often comes
                          down to how quickly his actions are registered, and an
